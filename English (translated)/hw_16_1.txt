1. **Addition of Functions**:
- Check if the following functions have been added to the `Matrix3x3` class.
 - `determinant()`: A function to calculate the determinant of the matrix.
 - `trace()`: A function to calculate the trace of the matrix.
 - `norm()`: A function to calculate the Euclidean norm (square root of the sum of squares).
- **Evaluation Points**:
- Each function is correctly declared (return type should be `float`).
- Functions are appropriately added within the class.

2. **Implementation of `determinant()` Function**:
- Verify if the determinant is correctly calculated.
- **Evaluation Points**:
 - Correctly implement the method for calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix.
 - Return the correct determinant value for specific matrices.

3. **Implementation of `trace()` Function**:
- Verify if the trace is correctly calculated.
- **Evaluation Points**:
 - Correctly calculate the sum of the elements on the main diagonal.
 - Return the correct trace value for specific matrices.

4. **Implementation of `norm()` Function**:
- Verify if the Euclidean norm is correctly calculated.
- **Evaluation Points**:
 - Calculate the sum of the squares of all elements and take the square root.
 - Return the correct norm value for specific matrices.

# The following is a comment and does not affect grading
The distributed sample matrix is
{{2, -1, 0},
{-1, 2, -1},
{0, -1, -2}}.
For this matrix,
Determinant (det) = -8
Trace (trace) = 2
Euclidean Norm (norm) = 4
should be the correct results.
