1. **Implementation of calcPI Function**: Implement a function `double calcPI(int N)` which takes an integer N as an argument (3 points will be deducted if not satisfied).
2. **Approximation of Pi Using Fourier Series**: Within the calcPI function, implement the process to approximate the value of Ï€ as follows:
-- Use a for or while loop to iterate a counter k from 0 to N, calculating (-1)^k / (2k+1) and summing up the results. Note that the continuation condition for a for loop should be k<=N, not k<N.
-- Multiply the obtained sum by 4.
3. **Attempts to Calculate Pi Approximation**: Change the argument of calcPI to 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, and 10000000, and output the result of each calculation to standard output.
4. **Accuracy of Execution Results**: Ensure the outputted results are correct values.
