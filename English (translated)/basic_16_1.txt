1. **Character Loading**:
- **Overview**: Verify that a program is created using the `Ex~~~` classes made by others, where many characters move around autonomously.
- **Evaluation Points**:
 - Correctly import five or more `Ex~~~` classes from the same lab.
 - Each character is freely moving within the screen.

2. **Switching Display Style with Mouse Button**:
- **Overview**: Check if the implementation allows all characters to switch to a different display style when the mouse button is pressed.
- **Evaluation Points**:
 - Correctly detect the state of the mouse button.
 - Use `displayActive` while the mouse is pressed and `displayInactive` when it is not pressed to switch displays.

3. **Character Management**:
- **Overview**: Ensure characters are managed properly and operate efficiently.
- **Evaluation Points**:
 - Use `ArrayList` to manage character objects appropriately.
 - Correctly add, remove, and update characters.
