1. **Class Inheritance**:
- CircleClass, SquareClass, CrossClass, and TriangleClass inherit from the ObjectBase class.
 - Evaluation Points:
  - Ensure appropriate inheritance in class declarations.
2. **Object Implementation**:
- CircleClass displays a moving red circle.
- SquareClass displays a moving blue square.
- CrossClass displays a moving black "Ã—".
- TriangleClass displays a moving green triangle.
 - Evaluation Points:
  - Confirm correct implementation of drawing processes.
  - Verify that colors and shapes are as specified.
3. **Object Creation and Behavior**:
- Create 50 instances of each class.
- Each object's speed in both x and y directions is a real number between -5 and 5.
 - Evaluation Points:
  - Confirm correct number of objects are created.
  - Ensure initial speed values are set randomly within the specified range.
4. **Boundary Behavior**:
- CircleClass and SquareClass objects bounce off the edges of the screen.
- CrossClass and TriangleClass objects reappear on the opposite side if they move out of the screen (screen looping).
5. **ArrayList Usage**:
- Use ArrayList for managing objects.
