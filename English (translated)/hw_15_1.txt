1. **Class Inheritance**:
- Ensure that the `TimerCore` class is correctly inherited.
 - **Evaluation Points**:
  - The timer class should properly inherit from `TimerCore`.
  - The properties and methods of the parent class (e.g., basic timer functions) should be used correctly.
2. **Timer Class Creation**:
- Verify the creation of at least two timer classes inspired by `TextTimer` and `ProgressTimer`.
  - **Evaluation Points**:
   - Each new timer class should have unique features or display methods.
3. **Timer Function Implementation**:
- Confirm that the timer accurately measures 60 seconds after a click.
 - **Evaluation Points**:
  - The timer should start upon a click trigger.
  - The 60-second measurement should be accurate.
4. **Timer Display**:
- Verify that at least three instances of each new timer class are displayed.
 - **Evaluation Points**:
  - At least three instances from each timer class should be generated and displayed on the screen.
