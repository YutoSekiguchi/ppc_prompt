The character's eyes should meet the following conditions.

If there are multiple eyes, each eye will be scored individually, and the highest-scoring eye will be used as the scoring target.

1. The black eye is following the direction of the mouse cursor (3 points).
2. The black eye's movement range is either the range of the white eye or a separately defined circular range, and the black eye does not follow the mouse cursor beyond that range (3 points).

The following is a memo and will not be included in the evaluation.
- For example, if the white eye's range is an ellipse and the black eye's movement range is a circle, and the black eye slightly sticks out of the white eye, there will be no penalty.
- If the black eye follows the mouse cursor within an elliptical range, there will be no penalty. It's a great job, so please give them a compliment.
