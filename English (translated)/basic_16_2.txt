1. **Object Generation**:
- **Overview**: Ensure that each click within an 800x600 window generates either a red circle or a blue square at the click location.
- **Evaluation Points**:
 - An object is generated at the clicked position.
 - Red circles and blue squares are generated randomly.
 - Position is set without using `mouseX` and `mouseY` in the constructor.

2. **Object Behavior**:
- **Overview**: Confirm that circles and squares exhibit specified behaviors.
- **Evaluation Points**:
 - Circles bounce off the walls in all directions.
 - Squares reappear from the opposite side when reaching an edge (screen looping).
 - Object speed is a real number between -5 and 5 in both x and y directions.

3. **Object Size**:
- **Overview**: Verify that the sizes of circles and squares are set randomly within specified ranges.
- **Evaluation Points**:
 - Circles have a random diameter between 5 and 60 upon generation.
 - Squares have a random side length between 10 and 40 upon generation.
