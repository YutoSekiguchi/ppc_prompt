1. **Window Size**: The window size is `size(800, 800)`.
2. **Using drawCharacter Function**: Utilizes the drawCharacter function that draws a character at a given 2D coordinate.
3. **Initial Position**: The character is drawn at the center of the screen (400, 400).
4. **Character Movement**: The x-coordinate is incremented by 1, moving the character automatically from left to right.
5. **Loop Movement**: The character reappears on the left edge when reaching the right edge.

### Evaluation of Insufficient Points
1. The right edge and left edge are not perfectly aligned when the character reappears from the right edge to the left edge.
・Even if it's not perfect, if the character moves from the right edge to the left edge, it's acceptable. This is not a requirement explicitly stated in the task, so it will not be subject to penalty.
2. The initial position is not specified as a numerical value (400, 400).
・If the calculated result is 400, it's acceptable even if it's not explicitly stated as 400. However, please note that frameCount starts from 1 in the draw function.
3. The character movement does not increment the x-coordinate by 1.
・If the movement is achieved using frameCount or similar methods, it's acceptable even if it's not explicitly stated as incrementing by 1. This is not a requirement explicitly stated in the task, so it will not be subject to penalty.
4. The presence of translate(cx-250, cy-250).
・This is part of the distributed program, so it will not be subject to penalty.
